1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
- For this assignment, I chose to use Python as the programming language and a combination of the pandas and sys libraries. I used Python because for developing this program because of three main reasons. The first reason is that Python is the programming language I am most familar with. Secondly, Python is an excellent language for both software engineering and data analysis. Since this assignment included aspects of data analysis and software engineering, this language seemed perfect. Finally, Python comes with a large standard library that provides a wide range of built-in functions and modules that can be used for various tasks. Python also has a vast collection of third-party libraries that can be used to extend this program's functionality. Many of these libraries are open source, making them freely available for use in this assigment.

  In particular, I chose pandas due to its powerful data manipulation capabilities, which enable easy handling and analysis of large datasets. Pandas provides a rich set of tools for working with structured data, including reading and writing data to various file formats, cleaning, transforming, and merging data, as well as grouping, aggregating, and summarizing data. This made it a natural choice for processing the transaction data stored in a CSV file for this exercise. 

  I also used the sys library to accept command line arguments, which allows the user to specify the number of points they want to spend and the name of the transaction data file to read. Overall, the combination of Python, pandas, and sys allowed me to create a solution that is both efficient and flexible, with the ability to handle large datasets and various user inputs.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
- One of the main advantages of my solution is that the use of the pandas library allows for efficient handling of large datasets and easy data manipulation. The pandas library can efficiently read the CSV file and convert it into a dataframe. Dataframes are powerful objects that allow us to perform analtical operations and transformations almost instantly. Hence, if transactions.csv contained 10000 rows, this program would still run effeciently. My solutions also handles error cases well and provides informative error messages to the user. My solution also contains well documented code with comments and sensible variable names, so it can be used by another user.

Right now, my solution does not focus much on modularity and resuability. To improve the modularity and reusability of my code, I can break down the balances function into smaller, more focused functions, each responsible for a specific task, such as reading the CSV file, calculating the point balances, and spending the points. This would also make it easier to write unit tests for each function and debug any issues.

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
- As an avid basketball fan and supporter of the Milwaukee Bucks, I was curious about the MVP selection process and why certain players didn't receive the award despite impressive season statistics. To address this curiosity, I undertook a summer project to build a program utilizing a machine learning model that could accurately predict the MVP award winner using comprehensive season data. I utilized Python and R programming languages with various regression frameworks such as Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost to analyze data from the Scikit-learn library. Through this project, I developed my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Additionally, I gained experience in model selection, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning. The project was especially meaningful as it culminated in a model that could predict MVP award winners with high accuracy, including the 2021-22 season award winner. Overall, the project was a challenging and rewarding experience that helped me grow as a data scientist and as a basketball fan.
