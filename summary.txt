1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
- For this assignment, I chose to use Python as the programming language and a combination of the pandas and sys libraries. I used Python because for developing this program because of three main reasons. The first reason is that Python is the programming language I am most familar with. Secondly, Python is an excellent language for both software engineering and data analysis. Since this assignment included aspects of data analysis and software engineering, this language seemed perfect. Finally, Python comes with a large standard library that provides a wide range of built-in functions and modules that can be used for various tasks. Python also has a vast collection of third-party libraries that can be used to extend this program's functionality. Many of these libraries are open source, making them freely available for use in this assigment.

  In particular, I chose pandas due to its powerful data manipulation capabilities, which enable easy handling and analysis of large datasets. Pandas provides a rich set of tools for working with structured data, including reading and writing data to various file formats, cleaning, transforming, and merging data, as well as grouping, aggregating, and summarizing data. This made it a natural choice for processing the transaction data stored in a CSV file for this exercise. 

  I also used the sys library to accept command line arguments, which allows the user to specify the number of points they want to spend and the name of the transaction data file to read. Overall, the combination of Python, pandas, and sys allowed me to create a solution that is both efficient and flexible, with the ability to handle large datasets and various user inputs.
