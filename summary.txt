1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
- For this assignment, I chose to use Python as the programming language and a combination of libraries including pandas and sys. Python is a popular and widely-used language known for its simplicity, readability, and vast libraries, which make it a suitable choice for data analysis tasks. 

  In particular, I chose pandas due to its powerful data manipulation capabilities, which enable easy handling and analysis of large datasets. Pandas provides a rich set of tools for working with structured data, including reading and writing data to various file formats, cleaning, transforming, and merging data, as well as grouping, aggregating, and summarizing data. This made it a natural choice for processing the transaction data stored in a CSV file for this exercise. 

  I also used the sys library to accept command line arguments, which allows the user to specify the number of points they want to spend and the name of the transaction data file to read. Overall, the combination of Python, pandas, and sys allowed me to create a solution that is both efficient and flexible, with the ability to handle large datasets and various user inputs.
